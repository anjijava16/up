Cell_PCH state
No transmission of signalling and traffic data dedicated to the UE (no DCCH and no DTCH)
But the RRC connection is still active (UTRAN keeps RNTI for UE) and UE location at a cell level. 
- a DCCH (and possibly a DTCH) can be reestablished very quickly (this procedure is initiated by sending a paging signal PCH)


 URA: UTRAN Registration Area (a small set of cells)

Cell_PCH and URA_PCH states are needed for non real time services to optimise usage of codes and battery consumption. It would not be efficient to allocate permanently a DCH which would be used a very low percentage of time (Web application for example)

 What is the difference between idle mode, Cell_PCH and URA_PCH states?
In idle mode the location of the UE is not known by the UTRAN, but only by the CN at a Location Area (LA) or Routing Area (RA) level (LA and RA and sets of cells larger than URA, see Subchapter “5.8 Mobility Management” for more details) 
The paging message PCH must hence be sent in a LA or in a RA when the UE is in idle mode, whereas it only needs to be sent in a cell in Cell_PCH state or in an URA when the UE is in URA_PCH state (hence the paging procedure is much faster).
