LTE for UMTS (page 55)
Mobility Management: The MME keeps track of the location of all UEs in its service
area. When a UE makes its ﬁrst registration to the network, the MME will create an
entry for the UE, and signal the location to the HSS in the UE’s home network. The
MME requests the appropriate resources to be set up in the eNodeB, as well as in
the S-GW which it selects for the UE. The MME will then keep tracking the UE’s
location either on the level of eNodeB, if the UE remains connected, i.e. is in active
communication, or at the level of Tracking Area (TA), which is a group of eNodeBs in
case the UE goes to idle mode, and maintaining a through connected data path is not
needed. The MME controls the setting up and releasing of resources based on the UE’s
activity mode changes. The MME also participates in control signalling for handover
of an active mode UE between eNodeBs, S-GWs or MMEs. MME is involved in every
eNodeB change, since there is no separate Radio Network Controller to hide most of
these events. An idle UE will report its location either periodically, or when it moves
to another Tracking Area. If data are received from the external networks for an idle
UE, the MME will be notiﬁed, and it requests the eNodeBs in the TA that is stored
for the UE to page the UE.
